# Security Fixes Applied to ALX Polly

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the ALX Polly application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. ✅ Broken Authorization in Delete Poll Function
**Issue**: Any authenticated user could delete any poll by providing the poll ID.
**Fix**: Added ownership validation to ensure users can only delete their own polls.
**Location**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - `deletePoll()` function

### 2. ✅ Unauthorized Admin Access
**Issue**: Admin panel was accessible to all authenticated users.
**Fix**: 
- Created role-based access control system
- Added admin email whitelist
- Created separate admin actions with proper authorization
**Location**: 
- `app/lib/utils/admin.ts` (new)
- `app/lib/actions/admin-actions.ts` (new)
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx` (updated)

### 3. ✅ Vote Manipulation Prevention
**Issue**: No validation of poll existence, duplicate voting prevention, or rate limiting.
**Fix**:
- Added poll existence validation
- Implemented duplicate vote prevention for authenticated users
- Added rate limiting for vote submissions
- Basic anonymous vote protection
**Location**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - `submitVote()` function

### 4. ✅ Input Validation and Sanitization
**Issue**: No proper validation of poll questions and options.
**Fix**:
- Added length limits for questions (500 chars) and options (200 chars)
- Limited maximum number of options (10)
- Input sanitization and trimming
- Type validation
**Location**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - `createPoll()` and `updatePoll()` functions

### 5. ✅ Server-Side Route Protection
**Issue**: Client-side authentication could be bypassed.
**Fix**:
- Enhanced middleware with proper route protection
- Added redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- Server-side validation for all protected routes
**Location**: `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`

### 6. ✅ Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No protection against spam or abuse.
**Fix**:
- Implemented in-memory rate limiting
- 5 votes per minute per user/IP
- 10 poll creations per 5 minutes per user
**Location**: `app/lib/utils/rate-limiter.ts` (new)

### 7. ✅ Error Message Disclosure
**Issue**: Detailed database errors exposed to users.
**Fix**:
- Generic error messages for users
- Specific error handling without exposing internal details
- Better error categorization
**Location**: All action functions

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Role-based access control for admin functions
- ✅ Ownership validation for poll operations
- ✅ Server-side route protection
- ✅ Session validation on all protected actions

### Input Validation
- ✅ Length limits on all user inputs
- ✅ Type validation and sanitization
- ✅ Option count limits
- ✅ Required field validation

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Vote submission rate limiting
- ✅ Poll creation rate limiting
- ✅ IP-based tracking for anonymous users
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired entries

### Data Protection
- ✅ Ownership checks on all data operations
- ✅ Generic error messages
- ✅ No sensitive information disclosure
- ✅ Duplicate vote prevention

## Configuration Required

### Admin Setup
To configure admin users, update the admin email list in:
```typescript
// app/lib/utils/admin.ts
const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'admin@example.com',
  // Add your admin emails here
];
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Testing Security Fixes

1. **Test unauthorized poll deletion**:
   - Try to delete polls you don't own ❌ Should fail

2. **Test admin access**:
   - Access `/admin` without admin email ❌ Should redirect
   - Access `/admin` with admin email ✅ Should work

3. **Test vote spam prevention**:
   - Try voting multiple times quickly ❌ Should be rate limited

4. **Test input validation**:
   - Try creating polls with excessively long content ❌ Should fail
   - Try creating polls with < 2 options ❌ Should fail

5. **Test route protection**:
   - Access protected routes without login ❌ Should redirect to login

## Production Recommendations

1. **Replace in-memory rate limiting** with Redis or similar distributed cache
2. **Implement more sophisticated bot detection** for anonymous voting
3. **Add audit logging** for admin actions
4. **Implement CAPTCHA** for anonymous voting
5. **Add email verification** for new accounts
6. **Consider implementing API rate limiting** at the infrastructure level
7. **Add monitoring and alerting** for suspicious activities

## Security Headers

Consider adding these security headers to your Next.js configuration:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application is now significantly more secure and follows security best practices.
