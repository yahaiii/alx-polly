## Detailed Vulnerability Impact Analysis

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Broken Authorization in Delete Poll Function

**Vulnerability**: Any authenticated user could delete any poll by providing the poll ID.

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
export async function deletePoll(id: string) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  const { error } = await supabase.from("polls").delete().eq("id", id);
  // No ownership validation!
}
```

**Potential Impact:**

#### Data Loss & Integrity
- **Complete poll deletion**: Attackers could delete ANY poll in the system
- **Vote history erasure**: All associated votes would be lost
- **Business continuity**: Critical polls could be maliciously removed

#### Business Impact
- **Trust erosion**: Users losing their polls would abandon the platform
- **Reputation damage**: Public polls being deleted would harm credibility
- **Legal implications**: Data loss could violate data protection regulations

#### Attack Scenarios
1. **Competitor sabotage**: Rivals could delete successful polls
2. **Disgruntled users**: Delete popular polls they disagreed with
3. **Systematic destruction**: Automated deletion of all polls via API calls
4. **Ransom attacks**: Delete critical polls and demand payment for "restoration"

**Exploitation Complexity**: LOW - Only requires valid authentication and poll ID enumeration

### 2. 🔴 CRITICAL: Unauthorized Admin Access

**Vulnerability**: Admin panel accessible to all authenticated users without role validation.

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
const fetchAllPolls = async () => {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const { data } = await supabase.from("polls").select("*");
  // No admin role checking!
};
```

**Potential Impact:**

#### Complete System Compromise
- **Full database access**: View all polls, votes, and user data
- **Unrestricted deletion**: Delete any poll from any user
- **System statistics**: Access to user counts and voting patterns
- **Administrative privileges**: Full control over the application

#### Data Privacy Violations

### 3. 🟠 HIGH: Vote Manipulation & Spam

**Vulnerability**: No validation of poll existence, duplicate voting prevention, or rate limiting.

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE
export async function submitVote(pollId: string, optionIndex: number) {
  // No poll existence validation
  // No duplicate vote checking
  // No rate limiting
  const { error } = await supabase.from("votes").insert([...]);
}
```

**Potential Impact:**

#### Election/Poll Integrity
- **Result manipulation**: Skew poll results through multiple votes
- **False consensus**: Create artificial support for specific options
- **Democratic process undermining**: Compromise the integrity of decision-making polls

#### System Performance & Availability

- **Brand reputation**: Polls appearing unreliable or compromised
- **User trust loss**: Community losing faith in poll accuracy

#### Attack Scenarios
1. **Bot networks**: Automated voting from multiple IPs/devices
2. **Sockpuppet accounts**: Multiple fake accounts voting repeatedly
3. **DDoS via voting**: Overwhelming system with vote submissions
4. **Political manipulation**: Skewing public opinion polls
5. **Commercial fraud**: Manipulating product/service rating polls

**Exploitation Complexity**: LOW - Simple HTTP requests, easily automated

### 4. 🟠 HIGH: Client-Side Authentication Bypass

**Vulnerability**: Route protection relying on client-side JavaScript that could be bypassed.

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE APPROACH
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user) {
    router.push("/login"); // Client-side only!
  }
}, [user, loading, router]);
```

**Potential Impact:**

#### Unauthorized Access
- **Protected route access**: View polls and admin areas without authentication
- **Data exposure**: Access sensitive information without proper authorization
- **Feature abuse**: Use authenticated-only features anonymously

#### Session & Authentication Bypass
- **JavaScript disabled**: Complete bypass by disabling JS in browser
- **Browser manipulation**: Direct URL access to protected resources
- **API exploitation**: Direct calls to server actions without UI restrictions

#### Attack Scenarios
1. **Direct URL manipulation**: Access `/admin`, `/create`, `/polls` without login
2. **Browser dev tools**: Modify client state to appear authenticated
3. **Curl/API attacks**: Direct server requests bypassing UI validation
4. **Automated scraping**: Extract data without proper authentication

**Exploitation Complexity**: MEDIUM - Requires technical knowledge but easily achievable
